# wrapapp

> A minimal wrapper app for server-side mobile development.

##Description

This project is an introductory wrapper app using the phonegap framework.  The goal is to have an easily compiled project for beginners who already have web experience, so wrapapp only needs a couple tweaks to point it towards your site so you can begin developing mobile features using the technologies you're familiar with.

###Usage

Just edit **www/index.html** and that's it!  Point the *inappbrowser* at your site to develop completely on your server.
